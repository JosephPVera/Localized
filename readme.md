# Localized States in Point Defects (LSPD)
----
# Kohn-Sham states
Plot the Kohn-Sham states: [eigenplot.py](https://github.com/JosephPVera/Localized-States/blob/main/eigenplot.py).

# Localized states
Get information within the gap with [localized.py](https://github.com/JosephPVera/Localized-States/blob/main/localized.py) (it can be extended by modifying VBM and CBM).
[localized_Va_N1_2.dat](https://github.com/JosephPVera/Localized-States/blob/main/tests/localized_Va_N1_2.dat) file.



plot the below figures with [locplot.py](https://github.com/JosephPVera/DFT-calculations/blob/main/DFT/scripts/locplot.py). The **locplot.py** script takes the sum of the 5 heaviest values (most contribution) ​​in each band per k-point (sum vs energies), it also can be change for check the total contribution (tot) for each band per k-point (tot vs energies).
